    "Recall the [simple streamlit app](https://github.com/leontoddjohnson/simple_streamlit) and the [coffee analysis data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leontoddjohnson/datasets/refs/heads/main/data/coffee_analysis.csv) used.\n",

    "\n",
    "Update the script to train a **Decision Tree Regressor** model that predicts `rating` based on *both* `100g_USD` and `roast`, and saves the trained model as `model_2.pickle`. Notice that the `roast` column is categorical, so you'll need to convert it into a numerical label format:\n",

    "\n",
    "Update the *apputil\\.py* file to include a `predict_rating(df_X)` function that takes in a two-column dataframe, `df_X`, with columns `100g_USD` (numerical) and `roast` (in original text form), and returns an array containing corresponding predicted `rating` values. If a `roast` value is not one of the roast values in the training data, the function should only use the `100g_USD` value to make the prediction (recall `model_1.pickle`). Otherwise, it should use both features."
